Sublime Text 2 File Locking
====================

This is a quick plugin I wrote for a team project I'm working on.

Due to the lack of a listener in the API for detecting "open" operations that don't actually open an editing buffer (e.g. file previews), this plugin works best when those features are avoided.

Use at your own risk and hack as needed.
